  <h1>Solid Select</h1>
</p>

- **Built for [Solid](https://solidjs.com/):** leverages fine-grained reactivity
  primitives for coordination.
- **Flexible:** built to support a wide range of cases, from single selects to
  multi-select tag lists.
- **Extendable:** use the pre-fabricated components or build your own from the
  core primitives.
- **Zero dependencies:** Just pair with Solid and good to go.
